# Collective

Collective is a lightweight, user-friendly platform for collaborative writing, mirroring the successful model of GitHub. It incorporates essential functionalities like pull requests, difference views, and commit messages, while eliminating unnecessary complexities, negating the need for extensive technical skills. Our goal with Collective is to democratize text collaboration, aiming to make it as seamless and accessible as code contribution on GitHub.

The impetus for Collective arises from recognizing the limitations of current democratic tools, which struggle with large-scale collaborations. Moreover, the complexity of traditional Git-based platforms for non-code tasks discourages their widespread use for text collaboration. Collective addresses this, offering an intuitive, efficient solution tailored specifically for collaborative writing.
